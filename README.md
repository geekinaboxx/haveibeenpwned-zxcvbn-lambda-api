# **Your** 5-Min. Secure Password Scoring and Pwnage Protection API

(Already drunk the Cloudflare Kool-Aid? [Check out the Cloudflare-Worker version here](https://github.com/detroitenglish/pw-pwnage-cfworker))

Deploy a private, secure and serverless RESTful endpoint for sanely scoring users' new passwords using Dropbox's [`zxcvbn`](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) library while (k-)anonymously querying Troy Hunt's [`haveibeenpwned`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) collection of +5.1 *billion* breached accounts.

## Motivation
<a href="https://twitter.com/DetroitEnglish/status/1008276231199055874" target="_blank">People seemed to think this concept was neat</a>. An AWS Lambda REST API was the ~~best~~ only solution I could think of that's easy to deploy, language/framework agnostic and, most importantly, **https by default** üîí

---

## Quick Start
1. Create an AWS profile with IAM full access, Lambda full access and API Gateway Administrator privileges.
2. Add the keys to your ~/.aws/credentials file:
    ```
    [pwnage]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET
    ```
    To use another profile, set it with `npm config set haveibeenpwned-zxcvbn-lambda-api:aws_profile some-aws-profile`  (default: `pwnage`)

3. Copy/Rename `example.env.json` to `env.json` and edit as you see fit. Note that all entries **must** be strings, less we anger the Lambda gods.
    - (Optional) Define your AWS region of choice with `npm config set haveibeenpwned-zxcvbn-lambda-api:aws_region some-aws-region` (default: `eu-central-1`)
    - (Optional) Define your API Gateway environment (aka version) with `npm config set haveibeenpwned-zxcvbn-lambda-api:aws_environment some-version` (default: `development`)
4. Launch üöÄ with `npm run deploy`


### Development Server
You can boot this API as an express development server like so:
1. Copy/Rename `example.env.json` to `dev.env.json` and configure as you see fit.
2. Boot the development server with `npm run dev`

**Note**: Development mode will add some random artificial latency to each request in a feeble attempt to simulate the wonky network conditions we encounter in the wild.

### Configuration
The following options are configurable via `env.json` or `dev.env.json`:

- `"ALLOW_ORIGINS"`: A **comma-separated** whitelist of origins for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. If none are provided, all origins are allowed (default: `""`)
    - Example: `"ALLOW_ORIGINS": "https://secure.domain.lol,http://unsecure.domain.wtf"`

- `"CORS_MAXAGE"`: Value in seconds for the `Access-Control-Max-Age` CORS header (default: `"0"`)

- `"ALWAYS_RETURN_SCORE"`: Return the `zxcvbn` score even if the `pwnedpasswords` match value is > 0. See [Response](#Response) for details (default: `"false"`)
- `"DEV_SERVER_PORT"`: Port to use when running as a local server for development (default: `"3000"`)

- `"USER_INPUTS"`: Comma-separated list of words/phrases to be included in the `zxcvbn` strength estimation dictionary. It's a good idea to include e.g. your company and/or application name here (default: `""`)

- `"RETURN_ZXCVBN_RESULT"`: Return the full result of the `zxcvbn` strength estimation as a `metadata` response key. Refer to the [zxcvbn documentation](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn#usage) for details on what that includes (default: `"false"`)

Note that all `env.json` values **must** be strings, less you anger the Lambda gods.

### Updating
Update the Lambda API with any changes you make to the source by running `npm run update`.

Update environment variables √† la changes to `env.json` by running `npm run update-env`.

### Sorcery üßô‚Äç
Lambda function and API Gateway configuration are fully automated using the cool-as-a-cucumber [claudia.js](https://claudiajs.com/documentation.html) - refer to the claudia.js docs to learn more about serverless voodoo magic.

## REST API

Following a successful deployment or update, `claudia.js` prints a configuration object for your freshly deployed Lambda function, which includes a secure url for immediate access to your function:

GET the warmup endpoint to verify access:
```bash
curl \
  -X GET \
  "https://$FUNCTION_ID.execute-api.$REGION.amazonaws.com/$ENVIRONMENT/$PREFIX/_up"
```

POST user password input as JSON to:
```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  "https://$FUNCTION_ID.execute-api.$REGION.amazonaws.com/$ENVIRONMENT/$PREFIX/_score" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "password": "üçåüìûbananaphoneüìûüçå" }'
```

Optionally, include an array of words or phrases to include in the zxcvbn dictionary:
```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  "https://$FUNCTION_ID.execute-api.$REGION.amazonaws.com/$ENVIRONMENT/$PREFIX/_score" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "password": "roflcopters", "userInputs": ["MyCompanyName"] }'
```

### Request

POST user password input as JSON with field `password` like so:

```javascript
// pwned password
{
  "password": "monkey123"
}
```
```javascript
// stronger password
{
  "password": "wonderful waffles"
}
```
```javascript
// very strong password (technically), with supplementary dictionary
// NOTE: you'd be wise to test this client-side _before_ sending this request...
{
  "password": "emailAddress@of-this.user",
  "userInputs": ["somethingUserSpecific", "emailAddress@of-this.user"]
}
```
```javascript
// very strong password, with supplementary dictionary
{
  "password": "14HFF3vA8qremH9Fe3A9nsXw",
  "userInputs": ["somethingUserSpecific", "emailAddress@of-this.user"]
}
```

#### Be the best - cancel requests!
The scoring function will gracefully terminate when an aborted request is detected, though you'll still incur a Gateway API call and a Lamdba function call for the respective request and invocation.

But [Troy Hunt and Cloudflare offer us the `pwnedpasswords` API for free](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Donate) - and that's pretty cool üòé So please help keep overhead low by either cancelling open requests on new input, or governing requests on the frontend with something like [lodash.debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.debounce).

### Response

The Lambda gods will reply with an appropriate status code and a JSON body, with `ok` indicating successful scoring and range search, a strength estimation `score` of 0 through 4 per `zxcvbn`, and `pwned` matches, indicating the number times the input appears in the `haveibeenpwned` database.

```javascript
// pwned password: 'monkey123'
{
    "ok": true,
    "score": 0,
    "pwned": 56491
}
```
```javascript
// stronger password: 'wonderful waffles'
{
    "ok": true,
    "score": 3,
    "pwned": 0
}
```
```javascript
// password: 'emailAddress@of-this.user'; matches supplementary dictionary entry...
{
    "ok": true,
    "score": 0,
    "pwned": 0
}
```
```javascript
// very strong password: '14HFF3vA8qremH9Fe3A9nsXw'
{
    "ok": true,
    "score": 4,
    "pwned": 0
}
```

By default, if `pwned` is greater than 0, then `score` will **always** be 0. You can override this behavior by settings `"ALWAYS_RETURN_SCORE"` to `"true"` in `env.json`

If `"RETURN_ZXCVBN_RESULT"` is configured `"true"`, responses will also include a `metadata` key with the complete `zxcvbn` [strength estimation result object](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn#usage).

#### Errors

Failure will return JSON to inform you that something's not `ok` and a `message` as to why.

```json
{
    "ok": false,
    "message": "It went kaput üí©"
}
```

### Good to Know
The health-check endpoint `/_up` is included by default; this also serves as a handy means to warm-up a Lambda function container before your users start feeding you input.

Lambda's Node 8 runtime supports `async/await` natively, nevertheless deploying will transpile `src/index.js` to JS compatible with Node 6.

Finally, it may seem strange that deploying will first nuke `package-lock.json`, and then reinstall dependencies - it is a workaround for `claudia.js` weirdness that I cannot explain but occurs when retrying failed deployments ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

Handling user passwords is no laughing matter, so handle them with care and respect.

Just like your own users, assume that I have no idea what I'm doing. This part is important, because I have no idea what I'm doing.
